										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bridge connecting Russia and Estonia suddenly plunges into darkness. When the light comes on again, in the middle of the bridge, on the conditional boundary line, a body is detected. A joint Russian-Estonian investigation is appointed. The Russian side is represented by investigator Maxim Kazantsev, and the Estonian side is represented by inspector Inga Veermaa. Together, they will investigate a chain of crimes that are well prepared, masterly executed and contain “messages” to society on the topic of social injustice.</p>
